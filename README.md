# Northwind Traders Challenge by Maven Analytics
This is my SQL submission to the Maven Analytics Northwind Challenge.
This repository has sales & order data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious gourmet food supplier, including information on customers, products, orders, shippers, and employees tables in .csv format.  
This challenge was presented by [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io//) in May 2023.

Maven Analytics recommended analysis:
* Are there any noticable sales trends over time?
* Which are the best and worst selling products?
* Can you identify any key customers?
* Are shipping costs consistent across providers?
